# ToDo App

A kitchen sink where I implement a robust ToDo App from scratch to experiment with different things and newest technologies in web dev.

Some future technical ideas include:

- [ ] Web app with only local storage
- [ ] Cloud service with accounts
- [ ] Monitoring with Sentry & NewRelic / DataDog (incl. web vitals)
- [ ] Electron desktop app
- [ ] PWA
- [ ] Microfrontends
- [ ] Mobile App with React Native
- [ ] Support for Teams / Organizations
- [ ] Additional desktop widgets (menubar app, sidebar widget)
- [ ] Public REST API
- [ ] Integrations support (e.g. GitHub)
- [ ] Email a task

## Web App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

- `npm start` - runs the app in dev mode on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- `npm test` - runs tests
- `npm run build` - builds the app for production deployment

## More to come

TBD.
